scat - Schrodinger's `cat`
---------------------------
## Introduction
Imagine your file is penned up in a steel chamber, with a tiny amount of radioactive substance.  In the course of your typing `scat` there is a probability that a small radioactive burst causes a bit in memory to flip, but also equal probability that no bits flip.  If such a bit flips, the counter tube in a Geiger Counter discharges and releases a hammer that shatters a small flask of `sudo rm -f`.  One would say that the file exists if no atom has decayed.  The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having your file in the saved and deleted state!

## Usage
`scat $FILENAME`

## Output
That's hard to say

## Installation
Just add `scat` to your `PATH`.
